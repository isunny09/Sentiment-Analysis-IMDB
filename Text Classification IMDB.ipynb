    "The main aim of the project is to analyze the moview review data set to understand the sentiemnt or emotion expressed in the review and build a classification model that can accurately classify the sentiment of a given text into predefined category such as positive or negative. \n",
    "Sentiment analysis can be used in solving various business problems such as Sentiment CLassification, Understanding the customer feedback, Monitoring social media, Research market trends, Financial, Political and Social analysis and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main tasks to be performed in this project are:\n",
    "1. Analyze the data to understand what the data represents and how it can be transformed according to the end goals of the project.\n",
    "2. Preprocessing the data by removing irrelevant and special characters using a combination of Regex and NLTK.\n",
    "3. Tokenization of the text, Removal of stop words and lemmatization to reduce the words to their base forms.\n",
    "4. Using TF-IDF to convert the tokenized text into numerical features that the machine learning model can understand.\n",
    "5. Model selection, Training and Evaluation.\n",
    "6. Model deployment.\n",
